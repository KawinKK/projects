        content:"Green papaya salad (Burmese: သင်္ဘောသီးသုပ်, Khmer: បុកល្ហុង, Lao: ຕຳຫມາກຫຸ່ງ/ຕໍາສົ້ມ, Rakhine: ပဒကာသီးသုပ်, Thai: ส้มตำ, and Vietnamese: gỏi đu đủ) is a spicy salad made from shredded unripe papaya. It is generally believed to have been created by the Lao people and is considered one of the national dishes of Laos. Green papaya salad is also popular in neighbouring Thailand's Isan region, from where it spread to the rest of Thailand. Green papaya salad has also spread to the rest of the continental Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Myanmar, and Vietnam), as well as Xishuangbanna (China).",
